## Introduction

Deploying MongoDB on Kubernetes with replication provides a scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant database solution. This repository uses Helm to demonstrate the steps and configurations required to deploy a MongoDB replica set on Kubernetes. By leveraging Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities, you can ensure seamless failover, load balancing, and automated scaling for your MongoDB clusters.

## Key Features

1. **MongoDB Replica Set:**

-> A replica set consists of multiple MongoDB instances, ensuring high availability and data redundancy.

-> Automatic failover: A secondary node is promoted to the primary if the primary node becomes unavailable.

2. **Kubernetes Orchestration:**

-> Uses StatefulSets for managing MongoDB pods with stable network identities.

-> PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) ensure durable storage for database data.

3. **Scalability:**

-> Scale the replica set by adjusting the replica count in the values.yaml.

-> Additional nodes automatically join the replica set when scaled.

4. **Security:**

-> Secret management using Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data like passwords.

5. **Automation:**

-> Configuration scripts or Job containers handle the initialization of the MongoDB replica set.




// In next upgrade we will take care of SCRAM securty feature and using kubernetes probes. also adding flexibility Designed for both development and production environments. Can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster, including managed services like AKS, EKS, GKE, or OpenShift.
